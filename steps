"make directory for project"
"remember to use SUDO - we didn't"

sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0.dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential

"reboot"
"cd into the dir for the project"
"we tried making it in root - didn't work"

git clone https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr.git
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
cd {your path}/rtl-sdr/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON -DDETACH_KERNEL_DRIVER=ON

"we tried without the second flag - didn't work because the kernel driver 
	for the rtl-sdr was getting in the way."

sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

"reboot"

sudo rtl_test -t

"test should run and work"
"will throw an error that "No E4000 tuner found, aborting." which is fine"

NOW INSTALL RTL433

sudo apt-get install libtool libusb-1.0-0-dev librtlsdr-dev build-essential cmake pkg-config

"cd to project folder"

git clone https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433.git
cd rtl_433
mkdir build 
cd build/
cmake ..
sudo make
sudo make install
cd /
rtl_433

SHOULD JUST RUN!
